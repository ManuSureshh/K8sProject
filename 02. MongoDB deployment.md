## Since our 3 Tier application depends on Database, we need to deploy it first.
### Step 01: - Create a secret for MongoDB.
- Below are the credentials
  Username: - admin
  Password: - Avaya@123
- But we should not send a credentials as plain text. We should send them encoded.
  ```
  echo 'admin' | base64
  ```
  ```
  echo 'Avaya@123' | base64
  ```
