## Since our 3 Tier application depends on Database, we need to deploy it first.
### Step 01: - Create a secret for MongoDB.
- Below are the credentials
  Username: - admin
  Password: - Avaya@123
- But we should not send a credentials as plain text. We should send them encoded.
  ```
  echo 'admin' | base64
  ```
  ```
  echo 'Avaya@123' | base64
  ```

- We should use this encoded values inside our `secret.yaml` file.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  namespace: 3-tier-app
  name: mongo-sec
type: Opaque
data:
  password: QXZheWFAMTIzCg==
  username: YWRtaW4K
```
